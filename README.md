## 3. Strategy

The initial stage in the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which emphasizes the importance of considering not only the goals of the application's creators but also the desires of the users themselves.

Following this approach, a Value Proposition Canvas is employed to identify what users seek to gain from our solution and how we plan to address those needs.
