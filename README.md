## 3. Strategy

The initial stage in the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which emphasizes the importance of considering not only the goals of the application's creators but also the desires of the users themselves.

Following this approach, a Value Proposition Canvas is employed to identify what users seek to gain from our solution and how we plan to address those needs.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. UX Person
This application is designed to empower individuals on their journey to better health and well-being.

In response to the feedback received, changes were made to the UX Person. The "Brand &" section was removed, as it was observed that it was not being used.

### 4.2 Benchmark
In the process of developing an application, it is of vital importance to conduct a thorough analysis of the applications already available in the market, especially those that directly compete with ours, in order to ensure that we successfully meet the expectations and requirements of users.

Benchmarking is the key tool that allows us to carry out this activity, helping us identify both areas for improvement and the strengths of these applications. The goal is to effectively integrate these lessons learned into our own product, enabling us to thoroughly understand market expectations and user demands.

### 4.3 Customer Journey Map
A Customer Journey Map in the context of an application is essential to comprehensively understand how users interact with the platform throughout their journey, from the initial download to ongoing usage. This allows for the identification of improvement opportunities, customization of the user experience, and ensuring the application meets customer needs and expectations, ultimately contributing to user retention and the long-term success of the application in the market.

Regarding the adjustments made to the customer journey map, based on the feedback received, the section mentioning a tutorial for the user has been removed. This is because the tutorial was ultimately not integrated into the final interfaces of the application.

### 6.1 Initial Aproach 
Wireframes help us create simple and schematic visual representations of a user interface, which are used in the design of applications and websites. These drawings or diagrams assist in planning the arrangement of elements on a screen, such as buttons, text, images, and other components, without concerning themselves with visual or graphic details. Wireframes are a fundamental tool for planning and communication in the user interface design process.

### 6.2 Improved Wireframes
The number of wireframes was increased in response to feedback indicating there were too few.

## 8. Usability
After a heuristic evaluation conducted by members of another team, we will discuss the changes implemented in our project based on their findings.

A heuristic evaluation is a usability review technique for software, aimed at identifying issues in user interface design.

The evaluating team identified a series of problems in our project and created a prioritized list of the most critical ones. The issues resolved in this phase include:

- More methods for logging in were added.
- A field to confirm the password was added in the registration process.
- A section for editing user profiles was added.
- Icons were changed to improve the app's navigability.
- The typography of the ranking section was updated to improve contrast.
- The size of the icons in the AppBar was increased to improve their visibility.
- A logout button was added.

## 9. Accessibility
In our ongoing commitment to making our application accessible to everyone, we have dedicated this section to accessibility issues. We have incorporated various features to ensure that our application is simple and comfortable to use for people with different abilities. Our focus on inclusive design aims to ensure that all users enjoy a smooth and enriching user experience.

What was added in this section is as follows:

- Voice detection was added.
- Screen reading by voice was added.
- A more simplified language is used, considering individuals with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).
- Consistent and accessible color usage in design is implemented, focusing on inclusivity for all users, with special attention to cultural differences and autism spectrum sensitivities.
- Enhanced tactile control usability is implemented, focusing on button size, spacing, and clear labeling for improved accessibility and user interaction, catering to diverse motor abilities.
